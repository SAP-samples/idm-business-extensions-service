Mass administration jobs were identified by its name previously. This has been changed to GUIDs. Depending on the version from which you upgrade, you might need to update the value help for your jobs.
To check whether you have guides or job names inside the value help, run query:
select * from mxi_AttrValueHelp where valid like '%SAPC_REQ_TRIGGER_MASS_CHANGE_ACTIVITY%'
The valKey fields should only contain GUIS
To update the value help of the IdM BE standard jbobs, you can remove those values from the table mxi_AttrValueHelp manually and execute the job SAPC Setup Mass Operations (com.sap.rds.idm.mass.administration -> Jobs -> Initial Setup)
To update the value help of your custom mass admin jobs, You can remove the entries from the table mxi_attrValueHelp manually and upload new values for the value help using the mass admin job "SAPC Attribute Value Help - Upload"

Execute Job "Delete Request Config Items (SP4 patching)" (com.sap.rds.idm.mass.administration -> Jobs -> Initial Setup) to delete the old config items for mass administrations. Those are not used anymore.
